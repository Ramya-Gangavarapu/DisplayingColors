# Displaying Colors Project

### This project is a hands-on exploration of working with colors using web technologies. 

It leverages the following technologies:

* #### HTML: Used to create the project's structure and interface.

* #### CSS: Styles the user interface and provides a visually appealing design.

* #### JavaScript: Powers the color manipulation and interactive features of the project.

# With this project, you can experiment with various color formats (such as hex, RGB, and HSL), perform color operations like blending and shading, and gain a deeper understanding of how colors work in web development.
