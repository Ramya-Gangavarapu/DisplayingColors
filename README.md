# Displaying Colors Project

ðŸŒˆ An interactive project to explore and manipulate colors using web technologies! ðŸŽ¨

This project combines the power of:

- **HTML**: ðŸŒŸ Create the project's structure and interface.
- **CSS**: ðŸŽ¨ Style the user interface for a visually appealing design.
- **JavaScript**: ðŸš€ Enable color manipulation and interactive features.

Use this project to experiment with various color formats (hex, RGB, HSL), perform color operations (blending, shading), and gain a deeper understanding of how colors work in web development. Have fun with your colors! ðŸŽ‰
